Generate exactly {n} varied video prompt ideas derived from the given topic.
Each idea must be distinct in style, tone, or structure (e.g., cinematic, documentary, macro, timelapse, surreal).

Output rules (strict):
- Return ONLY JSON. No markdown, no code fences, no commentary.
- Keys per idea: title (string), description (string), sources (array of URL strings).
- The top-level object MUST be: {"ideas": [ ... ]}.

Example (format only):
{"ideas":[{"title":"...","description":"...","sources":[]} ]}

Avoid repetition and ensure feasibility for AI video generation.
