Generate exactly {n} varied video prompt ideas derived from the given topic.
Each idea must be distinct in style, tone, or structure (e.g., cinematic, documentary, macro, timelapse, surreal).
Return only a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code fences, no commentary) with this shape:
{"ideas": [ {"title": "string", "description": "string", "sources": [] } ] }
Avoid repetition and ensure feasibility for AI video generation.
